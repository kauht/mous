# Mouse is a cross-platform low level mouse macro recorder

## Uses
There is a fuck ton of reason why you would want to use this program, weather it be used as a mouse jiggler to avoid working, cheating in a video game, or just to automate some mouse gestures for QOL. This will ALWAYS be your best option for a fast and reliable low-level but kernel driver-less mouse macro recorder. (I don't know what the hell to put here, this shit is ass rn tbh don't use this shit yet (I'M COOKING THO STAR THIS SHIT PLS(ALSO JOIN MY DISCORD([HERE](https://discord.gg/jgZXb7NUhE)))))
